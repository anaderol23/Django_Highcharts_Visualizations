<h2> Overview </h2>
<p> This project contains a few <a href="https://www.highcharts.com/">HighCharts</a> visualizations based on the "AWS
    Honeypot Attacks" <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/casimian2000/aws-honeypot-attack-data">
        dataset</a> from Kaggle.</p>
<p>Front-End: HTML, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery </p>
<p>Back-End: Python, Django </p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The AWS Honeypot Database is an open-source database including information on cyber attacks/attempts.</p>
<p>The data consists in 451,581 data points collected from 9:53pm on 3 March 2013 to 5:55am on 8 September 2013.</p>
<p>However, since this project's purpose is to demo my freshly developed web development skills, I have only loaded
    54329 data points.</p>
<h5>Honeypot attacks definition</h5>
<p>As defined on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing)">Wikipedia</a>, a "honeypot attack" is a
    "computer security mechanism set to detect, deflect, or, in some manner, counteract attempts at
    unauthorized use of information systems. Generally, a honeypot consists of data (for example, in a network site)
    that appears to be a legitimate part of the site that seems to contain information or a resource of value to
    attackers, but actually, is isolated and monitored and, enables blocking or analyzing the attackers. This is similar
    to police sting operations, colloquially known as "baiting" a suspect."</p>
